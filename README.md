- 👋 Hi, I’m June! 
- 👀 I’m interested in video games, art, and science mostly, but I've also got a passion for ridiculously obscure historical facts.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning HTML/CSS! However, I plan to branch out to Python and Java as soon as possible. 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate with my spouse on this. I don't have any huge projects!
- 📫 How to reach me:
